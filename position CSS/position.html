            Canto I
            This canto, the prologue to Dante’s journey through the Inferno, acts also as an introduction 
            to The Divine Comedy as a whole. 
            At the age of thirty-five Dante realizes he is lost in a dark, terrifying wood. He takes 
            heart when he sees in front of him a hilltop shining in sunlight. But, as he starts to climb 
            the hill, he is frightened by a leopard which obstructs him in a threatening manner, and 
            then by an angry lion, and finally by a she-wolf – the most alarming animal of the three. So 
            Dante is driven back into the darkness which – as we soon come to realize about everything 
            in this poem – is both real and allegorical. (There are, throughout this poem, many kinds 
            of allegory. For instance, the leopard, the lion and the she-wolf – emblems rather than 
            symbols, and therefore in need of interpretation – are of a different order from the dark 
            wood, whose import is obvious.)
            A human figure approaches, and Dante, uncertain whether it is a living being or a 
            ghost, implores its help. The figure explains that he is the shade of Virgil. This is the poet 
            whom Dante, as he is quick to declare, admires more than any other. Virgil encourages 
            Dante, and explains that he must travel by a different road if he is to find a way out of 
            his difficulties.
            After making an obscure prophecy about the coming of a hound which will kill the shewolf and also be the saviour of Italy, Virgil says that he will guide Dante through the realms 
            of the Inferno, inhabited by the souls of the damned, who are beyond all hope; and also 
            through Purgatory, where the souls of those now doing penance for their sins are residing, 
            glad to suffer because they have the certain hope of going ultimately to Paradise. Virgil, 
            because he was a pagan who lived and died before Christ and so could not believe in Him, 
            cannot accompany Dante into Paradise. But he says there is another guide who will take 
            Dante there. Dante accepts Virgil’s guidance, and they set off.

            Halfway along our journey to life’s end 
            I found myself astray in a dark wood, 
            Since the right way was nowhere to be found.
            How hard a thing it is to express the horror 
            Of that wild wood, so difficult, so dense! 
            Even to think of it renews my terror.
            It is so bitter death is scarcely more. 
            But to convey what goodness I discovered, 
            I shall tell everything that I saw there.
            How I got into it I cannot say: 10
            I’d fallen into such a heavy sleep 
            The very instant that I went astray.
            But when I came beneath a steep hillside – 
            Which rose at the far end of that long valley 
            That struck my stricken heart with so much dread –
            I lifted up my eyes, and saw the height 
            6
            inferno i, 17–54
            Covered already in that planet’s rays1
            Which always guides all men and guides them right.
            And then the fear I felt was somewhat less, 
            Though it had filled my heart to overflowing 20
            The whole night I had spent in such distress.
            And as somebody, trying to get his breath, 
            Emerging from the sea, now safe on shore, 
            Turns round to look at where he cheated death,
            Just so inside my mind, which was still fleeing, 
            I turned to look again upon that pass 
            Which never left alive one human being.
            When I’d rested my body for a time, 
            I made my way across deserted foothills, 
            Keeping my low foot always the more firm.2 30
            And then, just where the hill began to rise, 
            I saw a leopard, light upon its paws, 
            Covered all over in a spotted hide!3
            It would not move, but stood in front of me, 
            And so obstructed me upon my journey 
            I kept on turning round to turn and flee.
            By then it was the first hour of the morning, 
            With the sun rising in the constellation 
            That came with him when stars we still see burning
            Were set in motion by divine love first.4 40
            And so I had good cause to feel encouraged – 
            About the lithe and gaily coloured beast –
            By that glad time of day and time of year. 
            But not so much encouraged that a lion 
            Failed to inspire alarm as it drew near.
            It did seem that the beast was drawing near, 
            With head held high, and so irate with hunger 
            The air itself seemed shivering in fear.5
            And then a she-wolf! Though she was so lean, 
            She looked about to burst, being crammed with cravings, 50
            She who’d made many draw their breath in pain.6
            The pain she caused me was so terrible, 
            And such the terror coming from her sight, 
            I lost all hope of climbing up the hill.
            1 According to the Ptolemaic system, accepted in Dante’s time, the sun was one of several 
            planets revolving round the earth. The dark wood and the comforting sunlight mark the 
            beginning of that symbolism of light and darkness which runs through the whole Comedy.
            2 He was climbing.
            3 This leopard is an embodiment of the sin of lust, or sensuality in general, commonly 
            associated with youth. 
            4 It was a common medieval belief that, when the world was created, the season was 
            early spring, with the sun in the constellation of Aries.
            5 The lion embodies the sins of wrath and pride, commonly associated with middle age.
            6 The she-wolf embodies the sin of avarice, commonly associated with old age.
            7
            inferno i, 55–93
            And like that miser, happy while he’s gaining, 
            Who when luck changes and he starts to lose, 
            Gives himself up to misery and moaning –
            That’s how I was, faced by that restless brute, 
            Which always coming nearer, step by step 
            Drove me back down to where the sun is mute.1 60
            Then suddenly, as I went slipping down, 
            Someone appeared before my very eyes, 
            Seemingly through long silence hoarse and wan.2
            When I caught sight of him in that wide waste, 
            “Take pity on me,” I shouted out to him, 
            “Whatever you are, a real man or a ghost!”
            He answered: “Not a man, though I was once. 
            Both of my parents came from Lombardy, 
            And both of them were native Mantuans.
            I came to birth sub Julio, rather late,3 70
            And lived in Rome under the good Augustus4
            When false, deceptive gods still held their state.
            I was a poet, and I sang the good 
            Son of Anchises who came out of Troy 
            When Ilium was burned in all its pride.5
            But you, why d’you go back to misery? 
            Why don’t you climb up the delightful mountain, 
            The origin and cause of perfect joy?”
            “Then are you Virgil, you, that spring, that stream 
            Of eloquence, that ever-widening river?” 80
            I answered, red with reverence and shame.
            “Oh every poet’s glory and guiding light! 
            May I be aided by the love and zeal 
            That made me turn your pages day and night.
            You are my only master and my author, 
            You only are the one from whom I took 
            That style which has bestowed on me such honour.
            You see the beast that made me turn in flight. 
            Save me from her, O famous fount of wisdom! 
            She makes the blood run from my veins in fright.” 90
            “Now you must travel by a different road,” 
            He answered when he saw that I was weeping, 
            “If you wish to escape from this wild wood.

            5 This is Virgil, and the poem he refers to is his Aeneid, whose hero, Aeneas, a refugee 
            from Troy (or Ilium), is the son of Anchises. The theme of the Aeneid, the events leading 
            up to the foundation of Rome, was particularly dear to Catholic Europe because Rome 
            eventually became the seat of the Papacy.

            This beast, the reason that you cry out loud, 
            Will not let people pass along this way, 
            But hinders them, and even has their blood.
            She is by nature such an evildoer 
            Her avid appetite is never slaked, 
            And after food she’s hungrier than before.
            And many are the beasts she’s mating with,1 100
            And there’ll be many more, until the hound2
            Arrives, to bring her to a painful death.
            This hound will not be fed with land or pelf, 
            But rather feed on wisdom, love, and valour. 
            He will originate in folds of felt.3
            He’ll be the saviour of low-lying lands 
            Of Italy for which Camilla died, 
            Turnus, Nisus, Euryalus, of their wounds.4
            This hound will hunt that creature high and low 
            Until he thrusts her back in the Inferno, 110
            Whence envy freed her first and let her go.
            I therefore think and judge it would be best 
            For you to follow me. And I shall lead 
            You to a region that will always last,
            Where you will hear shrieks of despair and grief, 
            And see the ancient spirits in their pain, 
            As each of them begs for their second death.
            And you’ll see spirits happy in the fire, 
            Because they live in hope that they will come, 
            Sooner or later, where the blessèd are. 120
            And if you wish to join that company, 
            One worthier than I will take you up.5
            I’ll leave you with her when I go away.

            Canto II
            The sun is now setting. This is a time when most creatures settle down to rest. Dante, however, 
            is preparing himself for the coming day-long journey and its hardships. 
            He invokes the Muses to help him give a true account of his journey. Then he tells Virgil 
            how he doubts his own ability to complete the task, and expresses his perplexity as to why 
            he has been chosen for such an unusual enterprise. He can understand why Aeneas was 
            chosen, the man of destiny who was to found the race that founded Rome, the ruling city 
            of a great empire and the seat of the Holy See. But Dante cannot think that any such destiny 
            is prepared for him. He can understand too why St Paul was taken temporarily into Heaven 
            while still alive. But no one could believe that Dante is worthy of such a favour.
            To these doubts Virgil replies by saying that Dante is simply afraid. To combat Dante’s 
            fear he will explain how he came to help him. Beatrice came to him in Limbo and asked for 
            his help to save Dante from damnation. She promised in return to praise Virgil frequently 
            in the presence of God. In answer to Virgil’s question, Beatrice explains how she was not 
            afraid to venture down from Heaven: the souls in bliss are not tormented by earthly things. 
            Beatrice describes how Mary, the Mother of Christ, had asked St Lucy to help Dante, and 
            St Lucy then asked her.
            With three such ladies caring for him (an outstanding example of the communion of the 
            saints, in contrast to the lack of a sense of community we find in the Inferno) Dante must 
            have nothing to fear. Duly encouraged, Dante sets off with Virgil.

            The light was failing, and the growing gloom 
            Relieving every creature on the earth 
            Of all its toil and trouble. I alone
            Was getting ready to endure the stress 
            Both of the road and the resultant anguish, 
            Which never-erring memory will rehearse.
            O Muses, O my genius, lend me aid! 
            O memory, who wrote down what I saw, 
            Here your capacity will be well tried!
            I started: “Poet, you who are my guide, 10
            Consider if I have the strength and skill, 
            Before you set me on this rugged road.
            The father of Silvius,1
             as you tell it, while 
            He was corruptible, travelled beyond 
            This world of ours, being still corporeal.
            And, if the enemy of all that’s bad 
            Did favour him, because of who he was 
            And what he was, and what at last he did,
            That must, to men of sense, seem not unfair,

            The City of Rome, to tell the truth of it, 
            Was destined to become that sacred place 
            Where his successor1
             sits in Peter’s seat.
            On this strange journey you ascribe to him, 
            He heard of things that were to bring about 
            His triumph and the papal power in Rome.
            That is a road the Vessel of Election2
            Went upon also, strengthening the faith 
            Which starts us on our journey to salvation. 30
            But why should I go there? By whose decree? 
            Aeneas I am not, and not Paul either. 
            That I am worthy no one would agree.
            And so, if I agree to go that way, 
            I am afraid of being overbold. 
            You’re wise. You understand more than I say.”
            Just as one is who unmeans what he meant, 
            Changing that mind of his on second thoughts, 
            Wholly diverted from his first intent –
            That’s how I stood upon that gloomy slope: 40
            By thinking through it, I’d consumed the venture 
            For which I was so eager starting up.
            “If I have understood your words aright,” 
            Answered the shade of that high-minded man, 
            “Your cowardly soul has simply taken fright.
            Fear often faces men with obstacles 
            To make them turn from honourable endeavours, 
            As beasts fear shadows when the daylight fails.
            That you may lose this fear and so come through, 
            I’ll tell you why I came, and what I learnt 50
            At the first instant when I pitied you.
            I was among those souls who are suspended.3
            A lady called to me, so bright and blessed 
            I asked her to make known what she commanded.
            Her eyes were shining brighter than the stars. 
            She spoke in her own tongue, in gentleness, 
            And said in that angelic voice of hers:
            ‘O Mantuan soul, the soul of courtesy, 
            Whose glory is still current in the world, 
            And shall endure till this world cease to be, 60
            This friend of mine (though not a friend of fate) 
            Is so encumbered on the lonely hillside 
            1 St Peter’s successor, the Pope.
            2 St Paul, the “chosen vessel” mentioned in Acts 9:15. Paul himself describes how “he was 
            caught up into paradise” (2 Cor. 12:2–4).
            3 In Limbo, described in Inf. iv. Limbo is the part of the Inferno reserved for those who 
            had lived virtuously but were not baptized, and so are held in suspense between their 
            desire for God and the impossibility of ever seeing Him. 
            12
            inferno ii, 63–102
            He has been driven from his path in fright.
            It could be that he has already strayed 
            So far I’m here too late to give him succour, 
            Judging by what in heaven I have heard.
            Now go, and with your noted eloquence, 
            And everything he needs for his escape, 
            Come to his aid. I shall take comfort thence.
            For I am Beatrice putting you to work. 70
            I come from where I’m anxious to return. 
            Love urged me on to this – Love makes me speak.
            When I’m once more in presence of my Lord, 
            I’ll sing your praises to him frequently.’ 
            At that point she fell silent. Then I said:
            ‘O lady full of virtue, and through whom 
            The human race surpasses everything 
            Beneath the narrow circle of the moon,1
            I am so gratified by what you order, 
            If I’d obeyed already I’d be tardy. 80
            There is no need to express your wishes further.
            But tell me first the reason you don’t spurn 
            Descending to this centre from broad spaces2
            Where, as you say, you’re anxious to return.’
            ‘Because you feel the urge to understand, 
            I shall explain quite briefly,’ she replied, 
            ‘Why I am not too frightened to descend.
            We should be frightened of those things alone 
            Which have the ability to do us evil. 
            Things are not frightening if they do no harm. 90
            I’m formed in such a fashion, by God’s grace, 
            That your unhappiness does not affect me. 
            Nor do the fires that rage throughout this place.
            A lady in heaven3
             has such great sympathy, 
            Given the encumbrances through which I send you, 
            That the stern judgement up above gives way.
            She called on Lucy, and she said to her: 
            “One who is faithful to you now has need 
            Of you, and I commend him to your care.”
            St Lucy,4
             foe to all malignity, 100
            Rose at those words and, coming where I sat 
            With venerable Rachel, said to me:
            1 The moon was considered to be the planet nearest to the earth. All above its orbit was 
            considered everlasting, and all below mortal.
            2 “This centre” is the earth, seen in the Ptolemaic system as the centre of the universe. 
            The “broad spaces” refers to the Empyrean, the highest heaven, the sphere farthest from 
            the earth.
            3 The Virgin Mary.
            4 A saint to whom Dante was particularly devoted. Her name is derived from the Latin 
            “lux” meaning light.
            13
            inferno ii, 103–142
            “Beatrice, veritable praise of God, 
            Why do you not help him who loved you so 
            That for your sake he stood out from the crowd?
            Can you not hear his cries of misery? 
            Can you not see him caught in a death struggle 
            Upon that flood as fearful as the sea?”
            Nobody in the world was ever so quick 
            To seek advantage and to run from loss 110
            As I, the instant I had heard her speak,
            Was quick to leave my seat among the blessed, 
            Putting my faith in your fine honest speech,1
            Which honours you and those who read it best.’
            As soon as she had said these words to me, 
            She turned her eyes, shining with tears, aside, 
            Which made me the more eager to obey.
            And so I came since she requested it, 
            And saved you from that savage beast that barred 
            The short way up the mountain of delight. 120
            What is it then? Why do you hesitate? 
            Why do you relish living like a coward? 
            Why cannot you be bold and keen to start?
            Are not three blessèd ladies, after all, 
            Concerned and speaking up for you in heaven? 
            And does not what I’ve said promise you well?”
            As tiny blossoms, when the cold night air 
            Has made them droop and close, lift up their heads 
            And spread their petals once it’s dawn once more,
            So I did also, after being exhausted. 130
            And such great ardour streamed into my heart 
            That like somebody freed from fear I started:
            “Oh how compassionate to bring me aid! 
            And you, how courteous you were! When she 
            Spoke those true words, how swiftly you obeyed!
            You have instilled such longing in my heart 
            To come with you, because of all you say, 
            That I have now gone back to my first thought.
            Now go, for we are thoroughly at one. 
            You are my leader, my master, and my lord.” 140
            Those were my words. And so, as he went on,
            I started on that rugged, savage road.
            1 Virgil’s poetry, especially the Aeneid.
            14
            Canto III
            Dante sees the terrible words written over the gate of the Inferno, stressing divine justice 
            and the everlasting nature of the punishment which it inflicts.
            Dante is understandably perturbed, and Virgil has once again to remind him of the need 
            for courage to face what lies ahead.
            Inside the gate there is no light, no quiet, no rest. The damned are running continually, 
            and to no purpose, after a banner whose significance is not specified. The souls here are of 
            those who were neither for God nor against Him. Having shown neither the courage nor the 
            energy to act decisively, they are now not good enough for heaven, and not evil enough for 
            hell. So they exist in a sort of antechamber of the Inferno. As if to emphasize the contempt 
            in which they should be held, not one of these souls is named.
            Then Dante sees a crowd gathering on the bank of a river, the Acheron. A frightening, 
            demonic boatman, Charon, comes towards them from the opposite bank to ferry them 
            over. He curses them. He also tells Dante that, since he is still alive, he cannot go in this 
            boat. Virgil silences Charon by mentioning the inescapable nature of the decision which has 
            brought Dante there. He explains to Dante that normally only the damned can go that way.
            As Charon’s boat moves off, another crowd of damned souls is already gathering to be 
            ferried across.
            Suddenly, the earth quakes, there is thunder and lightning, and Dante falls down in a faint.
            0
            You go through me to a city of lamentation. 
            You go through me to everlasting pain.
            You go through me to the forsaken nation.
            Justice inspired my maker up above.
            I was established by omnipotence,
            The highest wisdom and the primal love.
            Nothing before me was created ever
            But everlasting things.1
             And I shall last.
            Abandon hope entirely, you who enter.”
            These were the very sentences I eyed, 10
            Set out in sombre black above a gate. 
            Then I said: “Master, this seems very hard.”
            Then he to me, being quick to catch my mood: 
            “Here all misgivings must be left behind, 
            And all your cowardice be left for dead.
            We come now to the region, as I said, 
            Where you will see the people steeped in sorrow, 
            Those who have lost all intellectual good.”2
            And then, when he had looked at me and smiled 
            1 The angels were created first (creatures who, not being corporeal, are not subject to 
            mortality), and the Inferno was created to receive those angels who rebelled against God.
            2 Nothing but the truth, which is God, can satisfy the intellectual longings with which 
            human beings are born.
            “
            15
            inferno iii, 20–60
            And pressed my hand, from which I drew some comfort, 20
            He introduced me to the secret world.
            From this point, sighs, laments, and piercing groans 
            Were echoing throughout the starless air. 
            Hearing them this first time, I wept at once.
            Deformed and diverse tongues, terrible sounds, 
            Words venting misery, outbursts of rage, 
            Loud voices, soft ones, sounds of slapping hands
            Combined into a turmoil always swirling 
            Throughout that unrelieved black atmosphere, 
            Like sand which rises at a whirlwind’s whirling. 30
            And I, my head surrounded by that horror, 
            Said: “Master, what’s this noise that I can hear? 
            Who are these people crushed by what they suffer?”
            He said: “This is the wretched way of these 
            Sorry creatures: the lives they lived were such 
            They earned no infamy, and earned no praise.
            Now they are mingled with that wicked sort 
            Of angels who were neither with the rebels, 
            Nor true to God, but simply stood apart.
            The heavens, lest their beauty should be flawed, 40
            Reject them, whom deep hell cannot receive 
            Lest it should gain some glory on that head.”
            I asked: “What is it hitting them so hard 
            That they must answer with such loud laments?” 
            And he replied: “I’ll tell you in a word.
            These people have no hope of dying ever, 
            And their blind life is so contemptible 
            That they would barter it for any other.
            The world accords them not the least renown. 
            Pity and justice scorn them equally. 50
            Enough of this – you’ve seen them, now pass on.”
            I saw some kind of banner that was wheeled 
            Around, and racing round at such a rate 
            It seemed there was no breathing time allowed.
            And after it there ran so long a line 
            Of people that I never would have thought 
            That death had gathered such a number in.
            When I had recognized some of them there, 
            I saw and recognized the shade of him 
            Who made the great refusal, out of fear.1 60
            1 There has been much discussion as to who this is. Some say it is Pope Celestine V (r.1294), 
            who resigned the Papacy only five months after his election. Others suggest Pontius 
            Pilate, who washed his hands at the trial of Christ. The second seems more appropriate, 
            since this is the only shade in this canto who receives an individual mention, and Pilate’s 
            role in the Passion was so important. The point is that Dante leaves this character unnamed (in a poem which includes so many names) to imply that, since he is one of those 
            who lived so unworthily that they “never really existed”, he does not deserve to be named.
            16
            inferno iii, 61–103
            Immediately I understood how those 
            Were members of that dire denomination 
            Displeasing both to God and to his foes.
            All these wretches, who’d never really existed, 
            Went naked and were fiercely goaded on 
            By blowflies and by wasps that buzzed and twisted.
            These insects went on stinging them and streaking 
            Their faces with their blood which, mixed with tears, 
            Flowed down to where obnoxious worms were licking.
            And then I saw, some way beyond all these, 70
            A crowd upon the bank of a broad river. 
            That made me beg of Virgil: “Master, please
            Tell me. Who are they? And what can incite 
            Them with such eagerness to cross the river, 
            As far as I can see in this dim light?”
            And he replied: “All will be made quite plain 
            When we suspend our journey for a while 
            Upon the gloomy banks of Acheron.”1
            So then, with eyes cast down and full of shame, 
            Afraid that I might irk him with my speech, 80
            I kept from talking till we reached the stream.
            At that there came towards us in a boat 
            An old old man, whose hair was white with age.2
            “Woe to you, wicked souls!” he shouted out.
            “Do not expect to see the sky again! 
            I’m here to take you to the further bank, 
            To everlasting darkness, ice and flame.
            And you, you over there, you living soul! 
            Keep well away from these. All these are dead.” 
            But when he saw I made no move at all, 90
            He said: “By other ways, another port, 
            You will arrive on shore, and not this way. 
            You must be carried in a lighter boat.”3
            My guide said: “Charon, do not fret and fuss. 
            This is wished there where whatsoever is wished 
            Is always done. There’s nothing to discuss.”
            The shaggy jowls went silent. Nothing more 
            Came from the pilot of the muddy river, 
            Who had around his eyes such rings of fire.
            But those souls – every troubled naked wretch – 100
            Changed colour and their teeth began to chatter 
            Soon as they heard his rough-and-ready speech.
            They cursed their God, their parents in one breath, 
            1 The classical river of the dead, which must be crossed to reach the underworld. Its name 
            is derived from a Greek word meaning “pain” or “distress”.
            2 The classical ferryman of the dead. His Greek name is derived from his bright, fierce 
            eyes.
            3 The boat which carries the souls of the saved to the island of Purgatory.
            17
            inferno iii, 104–136
            All humankind, the time, the place, the seed 
            Of their conception and their very birth.
            And they huddled together in a crowd, 
            Weeping loudly beside that wicked river 
            Which waits for all who have no fear of God.
            The demon Charon, eyes like glowing embers, 
            Beckons to them and gathers them together, 110
            And with his oar he beats whoever lingers.
            As in the autumn, when the leaves descend 
            One after the other, till the boughs are left 
            With all that clothed them lying on the ground,
            In the same fashion Adam’s evil seed 
            Flew down towards the river one by one, 
            At Charon’s nod, as birds do when they’re lured.
            They move away across the murky river, 
            And well before they reach the other bank 
            Another crowd on this side starts to gather. 120
            “My son,” my courteous master then explained, 
            “Those who have died still subject to God’s anger 
            All come together here from every land.
            And they are keen to reach the other shore, 
            Because celestial justice spurs them on 
            Until their fear is turned into desire.1
            No soul that has been good passes this way. 
            So now, if Charon was annoyed with you, 
            You know exactly what he meant to say.”
            The instant this was said, the darkened land 130
            Shuddered, so violently that once again 
            I’m bathed in sweat, calling it back to mind.
            Out of the tearful, sodden earth a wind 
            Burst with the sound of thunder, sending up 
            Sudden vermilion flashes. I was stunned,
            And sank like someone overcome by sleep.
            1 It is as though the damned, in a very human way, wish to get the suspense over with, 
            even though they are going to their punishment. There is also here a hint of something 
            which becomes clearer and clearer in the course of the poem: divine justice consists in 
            allowing people to have what they really want, and the damned have chosen damnation.
            18
            Canto IV
            Dante is aroused by a clap of thunder, to find himself on the other side of Acheron. He and 
            Virgil are on the edge of the abyss which is the Inferno proper. Dante’s fear is increased by 
            the sight of Virgil’s pallor. However, as Virgil explains, this pallor is not the result of fear, 
            but of compassion for those who are suffering below. And so they enter Limbo, the first 
            circle of the Inferno.
            Here nothing can be distinguished at first but the sighs of the damned, who are not here 
            because they have sinned, but because they were not baptized. Virgil himself is one of them. 
            They sigh because of their spiritual grief: they endure no physical pain, but a strong and 
            hopeless desire for God.
            Dante asks if anyone was ever taken from this place to bliss, and finds that Virgil understands what is in his mind. Virgil describes the Harrowing of Hell – the rescue by Christ, 
            after His resurrection, of Old Testament patriarchs, one matriarch and others too many to 
            mention. These people worshipped the true God, even though they were not baptized, and 
            they were the first to go to heaven.
            Dante and Virgil see ahead of them a hemisphere of light, in which Dante imagines there 
            may be great spirits. Virgil confirms this, and says a special place is allotted to them. A lone 
            voice cries out to announce Virgil’s return. Then they are approached by the shades of Homer, 
            Horace, Ovid and Lucan, who welcome Dante because he too is a poet.
            When they reach the light, they see it is a castle with seven high walls and a moat. Inside 
            the castle are the shades of many celebrated people. These include, apart from the four classical poets, Trojan and Roman heroes, pagan intellectuals and three Muslims.
            Dante and Virgil leave the four famous poets and go down to the second circle of the 
            Inferno, where there is no light at all.

            A sudden thunder broke the heavy sleep 
            I’d fallen into, and I shook myself, 
            As people do when roughly woken up.
            From side to side I moved my rested eyes, 
            Standing erect, and staring fixedly, 
            In an attempt to find out where I was.
            The truth is I was standing on the brow 
            Over the valley and the sad abyss, 
            Receptacle of never-ending woe.
            It was so deep, profoundly dark, and full 10
            Of mist that, though I peered and peered again, 
            I could not make out anything at all.
            “Now down into a world where all is blind,” 
            Said then the poet, who was deathly pale. 
            “I shall go first, you follow on behind.”
            And I, who’d seen the pallor in his face, 
            Answered, “How can I come, when you’re afraid 
            Who’ve always comforted my fearfulness?”
            19
            inferno iv, 19–54
            Then he to me, “The thought of those down there 
            In misery has painted on my face 20
            That agony which you mistake for fear.
            We must go now. The long way urges us.” 
            And so he entered, and he made me enter 
            On the first circle that goes round the abyss.1
            So far as I could tell by listening, here 
            There was no lamentation but of sighs, 
            That trembled through the everlasting air,
            Arising from the grief, which is not pain, 
            Of all the innumerable multitudes 
            Of babies and of women and of men. 30
            “You do not ask,” my gentle master said, 
            “Who these spirits are that you are looking at? 
            You ought to know, before you go ahead,
            They did not sin. And if they have some worth, 
            That’s not enough, since they were not baptized: 
            Baptism is essential in your faith.2
            They lived too early to be Christian, 
            And failed to worship God as people should.3
            Among such spirits I myself am one.4
            It is for such defects, not sin, we’re here 40
            Among the lost, and punished but in this: 
            That without hope we languish in desire.”
            My heart was sickened when I caught his sense, 
            Because I recognized some men of worth 
            Inhabiting that limbo in suspense.
            “Tell me, my master and my lord, tell me,” 
            I said, because I wanted to be sure, 
            With faith that conquers all uncertainty:
            “Has anyone ever, through the good he did, 
            Or others’ help, gone out from here to bliss?” 50
            And he, who knew what I had left unsaid,
            Answered: “When I’d arrived but recently 
            I saw the coming of a mighty lord,5
            Bearing the evidence of victory.6

            2 The Jews of the Old Testament – those who worshipped the true God and lived in hope

            3 That is, as was done by the Jews of the Old Testament who were faithful to their covenant 
            with God.

            inferno iv, 55–94
            He took from here our primal father’s shade,1
            The shade of Abel and the shade of Noah, 
            And Moses, who made laws and who obeyed,
            The patriarch Abraham, David the King, 
            Israel with his father and his children, 
            And Rachel, won with so much labouring,2 60
            And many others, whom he took to bliss. 
            And you must know, no human spirits ever 
            Were taken up to glory before this.”
            While he explained these things, we did not pause, 
            But kept on making progress through the wood – 
            I mean the wood of shades crowded like trees.
            When we had still not travelled very far 
            From the circle’s highest point, I saw a blaze 
            That overcame a gloomy hemisphere.
            As yet we were some way away from it, 70
            But not so far that I could not perceive 
            That there were honoured people in that light.
            “O you who honour both knowledge and art, 
            Who are these men who are so highly honoured 
            Above the others that they’re set apart?”
            And he to me: “Their honourable name, 
            Still echoing throughout the world above, 
            Wins grace in heaven and thus advances them.”
            He’d scarcely finished when I heard a voice: 
            “Give honour to the celebrated poet! 80
            His shade returns which had abandoned us!”
            Then, when the voice had stopped and all was still, 
            I saw four lofty shades approaching us. 
            And they seemed neither glad nor sorrowful.3
            My kindly master, when he saw them, said: 
            “Look well at him who has a sword in hand,4
            And comes before the other three as lord.
            Homer, the sovereign poet, is the first, 
            Satirical Horace is the next to come, 
            Ovid is third, and Lucan is the last.5 90
            Since they, as well as I do, have by right 
            That name6
             the single person has pronounced, 
            They do me honour, and in that do right.”
            And as I watch, the glorious circle gathers 
            1 Adam.
            2 Jacob, later called Israel, served Rachel’s father for fourteen years to win her as his bride.

            Around that master of the highest style1
            Who like an eagle soars above all others.
            When they had talked a little while together, 
            They turned to me and made a sign of welcome, 
            At which my master smiled in simple pleasure.
            An even higher honour came my way, 100
            For they invited me to join their circle: 
            I was the sixth, with such great minds as they.2
            So we continued till we reached the light, 
            Speaking of things of which I must be silent, 
            Just as to talk about them then was right.
            We came at last to a noble castle’s foot, 
            Surrounded seven times by soaring walls,3
            Round which a little stream served as a moat.
            We went across this stream as on dry land – 
            I went through seven gateways with these sages. 110
            We reached a meadow growing green, and found
            People there whose eyes were grave and slow: 
            They looked as though they had authority – 
            They seldom spoke, and then gently and low.
            We drew apart onto some rising ground, 
            Into an open area full of light, 
            From which we could see everyone around.
            In front of me, on the enamelled green, 
            All those great spirits were revealed to me: 
            I still rejoice to think what I have seen. 120
            I saw Electra there, with all her seed, 
            Among whom there were Hector and Aeneas, 
            And Caesar, all in armour and hawk-eyed.4
            I saw Camilla and Penthesilea, 
            And King Latinus on the other side, 
            Sitting beside his child, Lavinia, there.5
            I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin out, 
            Lucrece and Julia, Marcia and Cornelia. 
            And I saw Saladin, alone, apart.6
            I had to raise my eyes somewhat to see 130
            Where the great master of the men who know7

            Diogenes, Empedocles and Zeno,

            Canto V
            Dante has left Limbo behind: now all the shades he meets have damned themselves by their 
            own actions. This second circle contains the lustful: worse sins are punished lower down 
            in the Inferno. King Minos of Crete is here as judge, and he consigns the damned to an appropriate circle of the Inferno, winding his tail around himself a certain number of times 
            to indicate how many circles down the sinner must go. Like Charon, he tries to warn Dante 
            off, but is rebuked with the same words which Virgil used to Charon.
            This circle resounds with cries of lamentation, mixed with the bellowing of opposing 
            winds on which the spirits are carried higgledy-piggledy, as once they allowed themselves 
            to be swept along by their passions.
            Virgil names some of these spirits, all of them more or less legendary people, for whom 
            the reader may well feel sympathy, so striking are their stories. But then Dante speaks to two 
            people who had certainly existed and died during his lifetime – Paolo Malatesta and Francesca 
            da Rimini. It is clear why these two spirits are associated with the others: the immediate 
            cause of their sin was their reading of a romantic episode of the Arthurian legends. Their 
            fate is pitiful, and it disturbs Dante so much (he has, after all, himself been much concerned 
            with literary depictions of love) that he faints.
            This, justly one of the most famous episodes in the Comedy, has itself become part of the 
            literature of romantic love. But a merely romantic interpretation of it would be inadequate. 
            Francesca is damned out of her own mouth. All the souls have to reveal their unvarnished 
            sins to Minos; but when she is speaking to Dante, Francesca tries subtly to exculpate herself, 
            revealing the very irresponsibility which led to the damnable sinful act. We find ourselves 
            sympathizing with Francesca, not because the judgement on her is too hard, but because we 
            have similar defects ourselves. The seriousness of the sin, with its dreadful consequence of 
            three damnations, is neither glossed over by Dante nor blurred in a legendary mist.

            And so from the first circle I descended 
            Into the second, which contains less space1
            And much more woe, whence shouts of pain ascended.
            Minos2
             is there, most horribly, and grinding 
            His teeth. He judges guilt as people enter, 
            And places them according to his winding.
            I mean that when the spirit born for ill 
            Comes in his sight, it makes a full confession; 
            And then that expert on all sin can tell
            What depth of Hell is most appropriate, 10
            Winding his long tail round himself to number 
            How many circles down it must be put.
            Always there are large crowds. Each one in turn 
            Must stand in front of him to hear his judgement.

            and note.

            inferno v, 15–57
            They speak, they hear, they’re straight away sent down.
            “O you, arriving where the wretched dwell,” 
            Cried Minos when he saw me there, neglecting 
            To carry out his task as usual,1
            “Watch how you enter and in whom you trust! 
            The entrance is so wide it may deceive you!” 20
            My leader answered him: “Why this outburst?
            Do not obstruct his fated journey thus. 
            This is wished there where whatsoever is wished 
            Is always done. There’s nothing to discuss.”2
            And now there is the sound of voices, loud 
            With lamentation, and I have arrived 
            Where outcries strike my ears from every side.
            I have come somewhere where all light is mute, 
            Where there is bellowing like a storm at sea, 
            With wild opposing winds fighting it out. 30
            This hellish storm, that does not slacken ever, 
            Whirls all the spirits irresistibly 
            Along with it, and beats and bowls them over.
            And when they come where rocks have fallen down,3
            Why then what outcries, wailings, and laments! 
            And how they curse the power that is divine.
            I understood how all such torments are 
            Destined for those whose sins are of the flesh, 
            Those who subject their reason to desire.
            And like a flock of starlings on the wing 40
            In the cold season, crowded all together, 
            So the bad spirits in that blustering
            Are carried here and there and up and down: 
            They are not comforted by thoughts of rest, 
            Or even diminution of their pain.
            And like a flock of loud lamenting cranes 
            Making themselves a long line in the air, 
            I saw shades coming and emitting groans,
            Borne on the onrush of that windy war. 
            So that I questioned: “Master, who are these, 50
            Punished so hard in this black atmosphere?”
            My master answered me: “The first of those 
            Of whom you wish to be informed was empress 
            Of many lands and many languages.
            She was so vicious, unrestrained, and lewd 
            That she made licence licit in her laws 
            To take away the blame she had incurred.4

            She was Semiramis – we read of her 
            That she was Ninus’ wife and his successor. 
            She ruled the land now in the Sultan’s power.1 60
            That other killed herself in love’s despair, 
            Breaking her faith with the ashes of Sychaeus.2
            Then Cleopatra3
             is the next one there.
            See Helen, for whose sake the times were cursed 
            With crime and woe, and see the great Achilles: 
            He too was overcome by love at last.4
            See Paris,5
             and see Tristan.”6
             And he showed 
            A thousand shades and more to me, and named them, 
            Of those whom love and lust had left for dead.
            When I had heard my teacher to the end, 70
            Naming the ancient ladies and the knights, 
            Such horror seized me that I almost swooned.
            I started: “Poet, I would be inclined 
            To talk with those two who go yoked together 
            And seem to be so light upon the wind.”
            Then he to me: “You try it when those two 
            Have come much nearer. Beg them by that love 
            Which drives them on, and they will turn to you.”
            Once they were blown towards us by the wind, 
            I spoke: “O terribly tormented souls, 80
            Come here and speak to us, if that’s not banned!”
            And just as doves, attracted by desire 
            Into their nest, their wings outspread and still, 
            Glide with a clear intention through the air,
            So these two left the throng where Dido was, 
            And came to us through that foul atmosphere, 
            Such was the power of my affectionate cries.
            “O living being, so gracious and so good 
            That you come visiting, through pitch-black air, 
            Us who once stained this world of ours with blood, 90
            Oh, if the Lord of all were but our friend, 
            We would appeal to Him to give you peace, 
            Since you show sympathy with our sad end.
            And anything you wish to talk about, 
            Whatever it is, we’ll talk of it with you, 
            1 Egypt.
            2 In the Aeneid, Dido Queen of Carthage had vowed to remain faithful to the memory 
            of her dead husband. She violated this oath by her love for Aeneas, and killed herself 
            when Aeneas forsook her.
            3 Queen of Egypt, lover of Julius Caesar and later Mark Antony, who killed herself to 
            avoid being captured by Octavius after the Battle of Actium.
            4 Because of his love for Polyxena, daughter of Priam, King of Troy, he let himself be 
            ambushed and killed.
            5 The son of Priam, he stole Helen from Menelaus, causing the Trojan wars.
            6 The adulterous lover of Isolde, who was killed by her husband.

            In these few moments while the storm is mute.
            I must explain my native city lies 
            Upon that seacoast where the Po descends 
            To the calm sea with all its tributaries.1
            Love, kindling quickly in the noble heart, 100
            Seized him: he was enamoured of this body 
            Killed in a way from which I suffer yet.2
            Love, who insists all loved ones must requite 
            Their lovers, seized me so with love’s enjoyment 
            That, as you see, love does not leave me yet.
            Love chose a single death for both of us. 
            Caïna3
             waits for him who took our lives.” 
            Such were the words of hers which came across.
            I, when I’d heard these stricken souls, inclined 
            My head, and for a long time held it down. 110
            At length the poet asked: “What’s in your mind?”
            Then I replied to him and said: “Alas! 
            How many pleasant thoughts, and how much ardour 
            Have brought this wretched pair to such a pass!”
            And then once more I turned to them to speak 
            And said: “Francesca, seeing how you suffer 
            Makes me weep tears of sympathy and grief.
            But tell me: in the time of gentle sighs, 
            By what and in what way did Love permit you 
            To recognize your dubious desires?” 120
            She said: “There is no greater wretchedness 
            Than calling back to mind a happy time 
            In misery – your teacher4
             too knows this.
            But, if you want to understand the root 
            Cause of our love – it seems you really want to – 
            I’ll tell you, though I weep describing it.
            We were reading one day for delectation 
            Of Lancelot and how love held him close.5
            We were alone and quite without suspicion.
            At several points that reading drew our eyes 130
            Together, drained the colour from our cheeks. 
            But one point only took us by surprise.
            When we read how the smile of the belovèd 
            Was kissed by such a celebrated lover,6
            1 The speaker is Francesca da Rimini. Born in Ravenna, she was married to Gianciotto 
            Malatesta, but fell in love with his brother Paolo. Her husband came upon the guilty 
            pair and killed them.
            2 Not only was her death violent, but it allowed her no time to repent.
            3 A zone of the lowest circle of the Inferno (xxxii), reserved for those who betray their 
            relatives. It is named after Cain, who murdered his brother Abel (Gen. 4:8).
            4 Virgil.
            5 The adulterous love of Lancelot for Guinevere, the wife of his lord King Arthur.
            6 Guinevere was kissed by Lancelot.

            inferno v, 135–142
            This one,1
             from whom I never will be severed,
            Kissed me upon the mouth, trembling all over. 
            That book’s a pander, and the man who wrote it: 
            And on that day we read in it no further.”
            While the one spirit said all this to me, 
            The other wept, and my disquietude 140
            Brought on a fainting fit. I seemed to die,
            And fell down as a body does when dead.
            1 Paolo.</p>
